Well. Finally I got around to putting this blog together. It is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. It is based on some guidance I got from [here](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) and [here](http://kbroman.org/simple_site/pages/independent_site.html)
