I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Yelp, in the Applied Machine Learning team. My work revolves around tackling a wide variety of ML problems such as Recommendation Systems, User Modeling, Customer Lifetime Value Modeling, Ads targeting. I enjoy working on massive datasets and building end-to-end scalable ML production systems. 

Before coming to Yelp, I completed my Masters in Computer Science from University of California, San Diego where I did my specialization in Machine Learning. Some of my favorite courses were: Recommender Systems, Deep Learning, and Big Data Analytics with Spark.
